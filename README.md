# debugging_js
This is literally here just for testing and debugging purposes. I created the repo in order to have a full automated layout of scripts, browser-sync, testing, and a complete App environment. The app present here is an example app. This repo will be pulled whenever I began a new project therefore, the app itself will not be updated but the automated environment surrounding the app will always be updated. Due to the fact that the example app here is not really important there will be no usage information present. If you wish to utilize the app take a look through the npm scripts inside the package.json.
## Contribution 
If you wish to add to the environment or make updates to the app or any other welcome improvements, fork this repo and submit a PR against the **"Work-Branch"**.
